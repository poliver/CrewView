### Configure the API Key
I haven't pushed the API key used by this project, so you will need to add configure it before the project will build. To do so, add a file named `config.gradle` with the following contents to the same folder as the root `build.gradle` file (keep the double quotes).
```
ext {
  apiKey="API_KEY_HERE"
}
```
